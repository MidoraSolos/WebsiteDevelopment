				I am a 21 years old with a degree in Computer Science from San Diego
				State University. I am in the process of looking for a full-time
				position as a front end/software Developer with hopes to further my
				knowledge as a coder/web developer. On my journey to expanding my
				educational horizon I began to research web development and how to make
				websites. Ever since then I have been fascinated with learning and
				implimenting these new skills.
